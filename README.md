Amazon S3 Bucket Setup Guide

<!-- Step 1: Sign up/in to the AWS Management Console -->

https://aws.amazon.com/console/

* I used root user sing up

Sign in with your AWS account credentials.

<!-- Step 2: Navigate to Amazon S3 -->

Once logged in, you'll be in the AWS Management Console.

In search bar type s3 and click on s3 - scalable storage in cloud

<!-- Step 3: Create a New Bucket -->

In the Amazon S3 dashboard, click the "Create bucket" button.

You'll need to provide the following information:

Bucket name: Choose a unique name for your bucket.
        (no spaces, no CAPS, or _)

* I choose:     butter-day-spa

Region: Select the AWS region where you want your bucket to be located. 

* use Region: US East (N.Virginia) us-east-1 

<!-- Step 4: Object Ownership (Optional) -->

In the Object Ownership  section we want to click on:  

ACLs ENABLED followed by BUCKET OWNER PREFERRED


<!-- Step 5: Block Public Access settings in bucket-->

In the Block Public Access settings section:

unclick block all public access then:

click the bottom two options:

* Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket or access point policies

* Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket or access point policies


* then click : 

I acknowledge that the current settings might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public

<!-- Step 6: Bucket Versioning -->

for this step either way is fine but if you would like versioning click enable


<!-- Step 7: Tags (optional) -->

Add tag if you want 

<!-- Step 8: Default encryption -->

encryption type is going to be the default:

* Server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3)

then bucket key: is set to ENABlE
